    <p><strong>Commercial prices for healthcare</strong> (especially hospital care) are expensive, varying, and opaque,  
      leaving patients and employers uninformed and disadvantaged when purchasing care. <br>
      Recent federal price transparency regulations require hospitals and insurers to publicly disclose their prices, 
      aiming to empower patients and purchasers to better access, compare, and negotiate prices, 
      and further stimulate competition and improve healthcare affordability.</p>

    <h6>Background</h6>
    <p>Commercial prices for hospital care are expensive, varying, and opaque. The federal Transparency in Coverage (TIC) Final Rule requires commercial insurers to publicly disclose their negotiated prices. It aims to empower patients and employers to better access, compare, and negotiate prices, and further stimulate competition and improve healthcare affordability.</p>

    <h6>Intended Audience</h6>
    <p>If you are shopping for a new car, you’ll notice that prices for the same make and model vary a lot across dealers in your local area. Similarly, commercial prices for the SAME service delivered at the SAME hospital vary widely across insurance carriers in your local market. If you want to find out the lowest commercial hospital prices in your area, this is the right tool for you.</p>
