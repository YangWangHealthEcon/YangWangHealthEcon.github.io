  <p><strong>Healthcare pricing can be complex and confusing.</strong></p>
  <p>Commercial prices for healthcare, especially hospital care, are not only expensive but also highly variable and opaque. 
    This creates a major challenge for both patients and employers, as they often lack the information they need to make informed decisions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Why is this a problem?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Patients:</strong> Uninformed choices lead to surprise medical bills, financial strain, and confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Employers:</strong> Difficulty managing healthcare costs for employees and maximizing benefit packages.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, recent federal regulations are here to help.</p>
  <p><strong>The Transparency in Coverage Regulations(TIC)</strong> require hospitals and insurers to publicly disclose their prices, a move designed to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Empower <strong>patients</strong> to make better decisions by comparing prices.</li>
    <li>Help <strong>employers</strong> find the best value for their employees' care.</li>
    <li>Stimulate <strong>competition</strong> among healthcare providers, driving prices down.</li>
    <li>Increase overall <strong>affordability</strong> in the healthcare system.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With these changes, both patients and purchasers will have more power to negotiate, compare, and ultimately access better pricing for healthcare services.</p>

  <h5>— Interactive Maps Comparing Low, Medium, and High Commercial Hospital Prices for States and Metro Areas</h5>
  <p>If you are shopping for a new car, you’ll notice that prices for the same make and model vary a lot across dealers in your local area. 
    Similarly, commercial prices for the SAME service delivered at the SAME hospital vary widely across different insurance carriers in your local market. 
    If you want to find out the lowest commercial hospital prices in your area, this is the right tool for you.</p>
    
  <p>This tool uses commercial prices disclosed by 5 national insurers (Blue Cross Blue Shield, CVS Health, Cigna, Elevance Health, 
    and United Healthcare) in 2024 for 10 common hospital services (normal delivery, C-section, hip & knee replacement, 
    spinal fusion, PTCA, septicemia, cellulitis, psychoses, colonoscopy, and EGD). 
    For each service, this tool shows the <strong>lowest, enrollment-weighted average, and highest commercial prices</strong> at each of the 
    <strong>38 states</strong> and <strong>50 largest metro areas</strong> in the US. </p>

  <h5>Why You Should Care About These Numbers</h5>
  <p>If you are a self-insured employer (ERISA plan) concerning about your plans’ spending, use the lowest market prices in your area as a reference point to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cap your plan’s payment rate (e.g. state employee plans or public option plans)</li>
      <li>Directly negotiate prices with providers, individually or collectively via purchasing coalitions</li>
      <li>When shopping across 3rd party ASO plan carriers during your RFP process, ask for price disclosure, compare prices, and ask for “price match” to achieve savings</li>
      <li>You can obtain sizable savings through active price shopping and negotiation, absent of utilization/access control.</li>
    </ul>     

  <p>For broader industry effort (purchasing coalitions, benefit consulting, plan carriers, health IT & analytics) and 
    policymaking endeavors on improving healthcare affordability, 
    this tool informs you the dynamic pricing patterns for commercial hospital care and estimated cost savings across the nation. </p>
    
  <h5>Method</h5>
  <p>The analytical approach follows Dr. Wang’s study

      Within-Hospital Price Gaps Across National Insurers (JAMA Network Open, 2024)</a></em>.
