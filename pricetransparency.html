  <p><strong>Healthcare pricing can be complex and confusing.</strong></p>
  <p>Commercial prices for healthcare, especially hospital care, are not only expensive but also highly variable and opaque. This creates a major challenge for both patients and employers, as they often lack the information they need to make informed decisions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Why is this a problem?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Patients:</strong> Uninformed choices lead to surprise medical bills, financial strain, and confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Employers:</strong> Difficulty managing healthcare costs for employees and maximizing benefit packages.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, recent federal regulations are here to help.</p>
  <p><strong>The Transparency in Coverage Regulations</strong> require hospitals and insurers to publicly disclose their prices, a move designed to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Empower <strong>patients</strong> to make better decisions by comparing prices.</li>
    <li>Help <strong>employers</strong> find the best value for their employees' care.</li>
    <li>Stimulate <strong>competition</strong> among healthcare providers, driving prices down.</li>
    <li>Increase overall <strong>affordability</strong> in the healthcare system.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With these changes, both patients and purchasers will have more power to negotiate, compare, and ultimately access better pricing for healthcare services.</p>

  <h3>TIC Hospital Price Compare</h3>
  <h6>— Interactive Maps Comparing Low, Medium, and High Commercial Hospital Prices for States and Metro Areas</h6>

  <!-- Section 1: Background -->
  <div class="section-content">
    <h6>Background</h6>
    <p>Commercial prices for hospital care are expensive, varying, and opaque. The federal Transparency in Coverage (TIC) Final Rule requires commercial insurers to publicly disclose their negotiated prices. It aims to empower patients and employers to better access, compare, and negotiate prices, and further stimulate competition and improve healthcare affordability.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Section 2: Intended Audience -->
  <div class="section-content">
    <h6>Intended Audience</h6>
    <p>If you are shopping for a new car, you’ll notice that prices for the same make and model vary a lot across dealers in your local area. Similarly, commercial prices for the SAME service delivered at the SAME hospital vary widely across insurance carriers in your local market. If you want to find out the lowest commercial hospital prices in your area, this is the right tool for you.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Section 3: Price Information in This Tool -->
  <div class="section-content">
    <h6>Price Information in This Tool</h6>
    <p>This tool uses commercial prices disclosed by 5 national insurers (Blue Cross Blue Shield, CVS Health, Cigna, Elevance Health, and United Healthcare) for 10 common hospital services (normal delivery, C-section, hip & knee replacement, spinal fusion, PTCA, septicemia, cellulitis, psychoses, colonoscopy, EGD). For each service, this tool shows the lowest, enrollment-weighted average, and highest commercial prices at each of the 38 states and 50 largest metro areas in the US.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Section 4: How to Use This Tool -->
  <div class="section-content">
    <h6>How to Use This Tool</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the state map for state-level prices, or metro area map for prices of the largest 50 metro areas.</li>
      <li>Choose the individual hospital service in the filter on the right.</li>
      <li>Explore the numbers for the state or metro areas you are interested in. In the drop-down list, you will see:
        <ul>
          <li>Medicare price</li>
          <li>The lowest, enrollment-weighted average, and highest commercial prices negotiated across the national insurers participating in that market, shown as percentages of Medicare prices</li>
          <li>Estimated price savings in percentage, if using the lowest prices (assuming you currently pay the weighted-average prices)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
