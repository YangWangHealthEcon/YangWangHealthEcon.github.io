abstract: >-
  Hospitals must disclose their cash prices, commercial negotiated rates, and chargemaster prices for seventy common, shoppable services under the hospital price transparency rule. Examining prices reported by 2,379 hospitals as of September 9, 2022, we found that a given hospitalâ€™s cash prices and commercial negotiated rates both tended to reflect a predetermined and consistent percentage discount from its chargemaster prices. On average, cash prices and commercial negotiated rates were 64 percent and 58 percent of the corresponding chargemaster prices for the same procedures at the same hospital and in the same service setting, respectively. Cash prices were lower than the median commercial negotiated rates in 47 percent of instances, and most likely so at hospitals with government or nonprofit ownership, located outside of metropolitan areas, or located in counties with relatively high uninsurance rates or low median household incomes. Hospitals with stronger market power were most likely to offer cash prices below their median negotiated rates, whereas hospitals in areas where insurers had stronger market power were less likely to do so.
