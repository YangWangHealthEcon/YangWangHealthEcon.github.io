  Our final sample includes 156 POHs and 1116 non-POHs located in 78 HRRs. POHs were smaller (mean[SE] number of beds, 
  5.0 [5.3] vs 162.0 [6.0]; P < .001), more profitable (mean [SE] profit margin,
  15.2% [1.4%] vs 7.1% [0.9%]; P < .001), and more likely to be for-profit (154 POHs [99%] vs 268 non-POHs [24%]),
  nonteaching (138 POHs [88%] vs 805 non-POHs [72%]), noncritical access (154
  POHs [99%] vs 850 non-POHs [76%]), and located in metropolitan areas (147 POHs [94%] vs 707
  non-POHs [63%]) than private non-POHs in the same market. POHs served fewer Medicaid patients
  (mean [SE] proportion of Medicaid discharge, 3.0% [0.5%] vs 7.1% [0.3%]; P < .001) and provided
  less charity care (mean [SE] charity-care-to-expense ratio, 1.3% [0.4%] vs 3.2% [0.1%]; P < .001).
  Most hospitals in the sample disclosed the commercial negotiated price or cash price for at least 1 of
  the 8 procedures. Nationwide median commercial negotiated prices and cash prices were lower for
  POHs by 4% to 33% and 5% to 36%, respectively, for 7 of 8 services (Table).
